<p><strong>6.1</strong> Purchases made from Chirp&#x27;s online store (&quot;Store&quot;) are intended for personal and/or internal business use only and are not for commercial resale. If you&#x27;re interested in reselling Chirp products, please contact Chirp at <a href="mailto:sales@chirpwireless.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales@chirpwireless.io</a> to receive details and authorized approval.</p>
<p><strong>6.2</strong> You agree to pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable, or as otherwise set forth in any applicable order. You must provide Chirp with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by Chirp) (&quot;Payment Provider&quot;), or purchase order information as a condition to signing up for the services. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing Chirp with your credit card number and associated payment information, you agree that Chirp is authorized to immediately invoice your account for all fees and charges due and payable to Chirp hereunder, and that no additional notice is required. You agree to immediately notify Chirp of any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder. Chirp reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the website or by email delivery to you.</p>
<p><strong>6.3</strong> You will be responsible for the payment of the applicable fee for any services (each, a &quot;Service Subscription Fee&quot;) at the time you create your account and select your monthly or annual package, as applicable, or as otherwise set forth in any applicable order (each, a &quot;Service Commencement Date&quot;). Except as set forth in these terms or any applicable order, all fees for the services are non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and Chirp for the services until Chirp accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of communication.</p>
<p><strong>6.4</strong> Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with these terms, or as set forth in any applicable order. Unless otherwise set forth in an applicable order, after your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a &quot;Renewal Commencement Date&quot;) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at Chirp&#x27;s then-current price for such subscription. Unless otherwise set forth in an applicable order, you agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at least (a) thirty (30) days prior to the Renewal Commencement Date (or in the event that you receive a notice from Chirp that your subscription will be automatically renewed, you will have thirty days from the date of the Chirp notice). If you do not wish your account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please contact Chirp at <a href="mailto:sales@chirpwireless.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales@chirpwireless.io</a>. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize Chirp to charge your Payment Provider now and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if Chirp does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that Chirp may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your account will be activated, and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).</p>
<p><strong>6.5</strong> Chirp reserves the right to charge you any overage fees accrued or incurred in accordance with your order. You acknowledge and agree that overage fees may not be invoiced in the month used and that any failure by Chirp to bill or invoice for overage and related charges on a timely basis will not be a basis for you to dispute payment of such charges.</p>
<p><strong>6.6</strong> Chirp reserves the right to change carriers, network access, and coverage plans at any time. In the event any carrier, network access, and/or coverage plans rates are increased by the applicable carrier or service provider, Chirp reserves the right to increase its fees upon notice to you.</p>
