# Examples of LoRaWAN applications
Examples of LoRaWAN applications are abundant. In agriculture, LoRaWAN can be used to monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, crop health, and livestock tracking across vast agricultural landscapes. Asset tracking becomes seamless with LoRaWAN, enabling real-time monitoring and tracking of vehicles, containers, and equipment in logistics and supply chain operations. Smart cities benefit from LoRaWAN-enabled solutions for smart street lighting, waste management, parking management, air quality monitoring, and other applications aimed at enhancing urban efficiency and sustainability. Industrial IoT applications can leverage LoRaWAN for remote machine monitoring, predictive maintenance, and logistics tracking in challenging industrial environments. Building automation is also made smarter with LoRaWAN, enabling energy management, occupancy sensing, security systems, and intelligent lighting control within buildings.
