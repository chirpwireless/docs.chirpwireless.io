# What is LoRaWAN?

LoRaWAN is a protocol designed for long-range, low-power communication in IoT applications. It utilizes LoRa modulation technology and Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) to enable robust and efficient transmission. CSS is a modulation technique that spreads the signal across a wide frequency range, allowing for long-range communication, improved interference immunity, and low power consumption.
