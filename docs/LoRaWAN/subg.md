# Sub Ghz Frequencies

LoRa Sub-GHz frequencies refer to the frequency bands below 1 GHz that are used for LoRa communication. The specific sub-GHz frequency bands used may vary between countries due to regulatory differences. For example, in Europe, the 868 MHz band is commonly used, while in North America, the 915 MHz band is prevalent. These sub-GHz frequencies offer excellent range and penetration capabilities, making them suitable for long-range IoT applications.
