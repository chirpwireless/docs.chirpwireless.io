# LoRa 2.4Ghz
On the other hand, LoRa 2.4GHz refers to the use of the 2.4 GHz frequency band for LoRa communication. This frequency band is globally available and license-free in all countries. It is commonly used by technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The advantage of using 2.4GHz for IoT is that devices from one country can work in another without frequency compatibility issues. This frequency band offers higher data rates and compatibility with existing infrastructure, making it suitable for shorter-range IoT deployments.

The key advantages of sub-GHz frequencies and 2.4GHz for IoT include extended range, better building penetration, and global compatibility. Sub-GHz frequencies can propagate over long distances and penetrate obstacles effectively, enabling reliable communication in various environments. Additionally, the license-free nature of the 2.4GHz band allows for easier deployment and global interoperability of IoT devices. This promotes seamless connectivity and simplifies the expansion of IoT solutions across different countries and regions.
