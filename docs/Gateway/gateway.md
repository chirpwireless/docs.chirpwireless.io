# Chirps IoT Gateway

An IoT gateway is a device that serves as a bridge between IoT devices and the cloud or network infrastructure. It acts as a central hub, facilitating communication, data transfer, and management between the devices and the IoT platform or applications.

Chirp Wireless offers a multi-protocol IoT gateway that supports various connectivity protocols, including LoRa 2.4GHz, LoRaWAN sub GHz, cellular technologies (such as LTE), and short-range protocols like BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), Zigbee, and Thread/Matter. This versatility allows Chirp's gateway to seamlessly connect and integrate different types of IoT devices, regardless of their communication requirements or protocols.
