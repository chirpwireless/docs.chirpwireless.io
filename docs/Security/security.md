# Security
IoT security is indeed a significant concern, particularly in government and medical applications where the protection of sensitive data and critical systems is paramount. Traditional Wi-Fi IoT networks have been known to be susceptible to various security vulnerabilities and attacks, which can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of IoT deployments.

This is where Chirp Wireless provides a valuable solution. Chirp's approach to IoT connectivity and communication mitigates many of the security risks associated with traditional Wi-Fi networks.

## LoRawan Security
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) incorporates several security features to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data during communication between devices and the cloud. Here are some key aspects of LoRaWAN security:

## Encryption
LoRaWAN utilizes AES-128 (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption to secure the payload and control messages transmitted between devices and the network server. This encryption ensures that the data remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

## Authentication 
LoRaWAN employs a mutual authentication mechanism to verify the identity of devices and the network server. This two-way authentication ensures that only authorized devices and servers can communicate with each other, preventing unauthorized access or tampering.

## End-to-End Security
Communication between the devices and the application server (cloud) in a LoRaWAN deployment is end-to-end encrypted. The data is encrypted by the sending device and decrypted by the receiving party, ensuring that the data remains secure throughout the transmission.

These security measures in LoRaWAN provide robust protection for IoT deployments. The encryption of data ensures that it cannot be intercepted or deciphered by unauthorized parties. The authentication mechanisms verify the identity of devices and servers, preventing unauthorized access. The secure key management scheme ensures the integrity of the cryptographic keys used in the communication.

## Dark Gateways
Chirp Wireless implements an additional layer of security for IoT gateways by adopting a "Dark" approach. This means that the gateways are not visible to the outside world and do not have an external IP address. This measure effectively reduces the likelihood of attacks and unauthorized access from external entities.

By operating in a "Dark" mode, Chirp's IoT gateways are shielded from direct exposure to the public internet. This isolation helps to mitigate potential security risks and vulnerabilities that may arise from external threats or malicious activities. With no external IP address, the gateways are not easily discoverable or accessible to unauthorized parties.

The "Dark" gateway approach enhances security by reducing the attack surface and limiting potential entry points for malicious actors. It adds an extra layer of protection to the IoT infrastructure, making it more challenging for unauthorized individuals to target or compromise the gateways.

This security measure is particularly beneficial for IoT deployments that prioritize data privacy and protection. By keeping the gateways hidden from external visibility, Chirp Wireless helps ensure that the IoT ecosystem remains secure and safeguarded from potential cyber threats.
