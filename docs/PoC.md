# Proof-of-Coverage (PoC)

## The Heart of the Chirp Network
The Chirp Network operates a physical wireless network that provides coverage for connected devices. To ensure that this network operates efficiently, the Chirp blockchain uses an algorithm called “Proof-of-Coverage” (PoC) to verify that Blackbirds (also known as Gateways or Miners) are located where they claim to be, and that they are able to connect to others. This algorithm is designed to ensure that the wireless network coverage provided by Blackbirds on the Chirp Network is accurate and trustworthy, validated in a decentralized manner that also benefits the security of the Network.

## Proof-of-Coverage Challenges
Proof-of-Coverage operates through a process called a “PoC Challenge”. In this process, one Blackbird is verified by multiple nearby Blackbirds to provide Proof of Coverage. The data generated by these ongoing proofs is recorded in the Chirp chain (DLT), providing definitive verification of the network's coverage.

The PoC Challenge involves three distinct roles: the Challenger, the Target, and the Neighbours. The Challenger constructs and issues the PoC Challenge. The Target is the Blackbird being challenged, and it is responsible for transmitting challenge packets to be detected by nearby Blackbirds. The Neighbours are the Blackbirds that are geographically close to the Target and report the existence of the challenge packet after it has been transmitted.

## Proof-of-Coverage Roles and Rewards
The Proof-of-Coverage is used to allocate tokens to miners on the Chirp Network. The division of tokens is equal between the Blackbirds, and the quantities of tokens distributed through PoC each year are predetermined in the Tokenomics document. These rewards incentivize and encourage people to join the network and install Blackbirds, which are referred to as Keepers.

## Proof-of-Coverage and Security
Proof-of-Coverage and the Proof-of-Serialisation used in its foundation are essential to prevent Sybil attacks, in which Miners forge false identities to subvert the network and extract rewards. Additionally, PoC is designed to protect against alternate reality attacks, which involve the coordination of groups of Miners to simulate real Gateways in the network without providing actual coverage.

## RF Signals and Proof-of-Coverage
Proof-of-Coverage is based on several unique properties of radio frequency (RF) signals. RF signals have limited physical propagation and distance, and their strength decreases as the distance from the transmitter increases. Additionally, RF signals travel at the speed of light without latency. To verify the compatibility of Miners with the CNP, the Challenger creates a multi-layer packet of data that is transmitted through a sequence of targets. Only the final Target in the sequence is able to decrypt the information, and the information is only retrievable if the sequence was not interrupted at any stage of transmission.

## Incentivizing and Encouraging Participation
Proof-of-Coverage rewards are used to incentivize and encourage people to join the Chirp Network and install Blackbirds. The division of tokens is equal among all Blackbirds, also known as Gateways or Miners, on the network. The quantity of tokens distributed through PoC each year is predetermined in the Tokenomics document and is divided equally among Keepers, or people who own the validated Blackbirds on the network.

In conclusion, Proof-of-Coverage is a crucial component of the Chirp Network. It provides verifiable proof of the wireless coverage provided by Blackbirds, protects the network from malicious attacks, and incentivizes participation in the network.
