### f)	Automated decision making
We do not process your personal data for automated decision-making which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.

## 2.	Data processing when using our gateway, our IoT devices and our ecosystem
### a)	Gateway
The gateway forwards information about the status of IoT devices connected to our ecosystem via the internet connection to which it is connected. Our system processes the information. This is the device identifier of the gateway, the IoT device and the status of the gateway and the IoT device. The transmitted information is end-to-end encrypted and therefore cannot be viewed during transmission.

We also process the IP address that the gateway installed on your computer automatically transmits to our server. We need this information to enable you to use our services.

The legal basis for this data processing is the fulfillment of the contract for our services, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. We store the personal data in question for a period of six months.

### b)	Trackers and devices that transmit GPS coordinates
Trackers transmit the device ID and current GPS coordinates. We process this information and store it in the account to which the tracker is linked. The legal basis for this data processing is the fulfillment of the contract for our services, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. We store the relevant personal data permanently until new GPS coordinates are received. They are automatically deleted after a period of six months.

### c)	Smartphones
Smartphones transmit the device ID and current GPS coordinates via our app. We process this information and store it in the account to which the smartphone is linked. We also process the IP address that the gateway installed on your device automatically transmits to our server. We need this information to enable you to use our services.

The customer also grants the installed Chirp app access to the smartphone's BLE functionality. BLE is used to form a BLE mesh network that relays information about BLE devices that are registered on the Chirp network and are within signal range. If a device is within range of a smartphone, it will use that smartphone to transmit information about that device to the customer. Only the customer of the device can see the information; the smartphone that forwards the data has no information about the device.

The legal basis for this data processing is the fulfillment of the contract for our services, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. We store the relevant personal data permanently until new GPS coordinates are received. They are automatically deleted after a period of six months.
