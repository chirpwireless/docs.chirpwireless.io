Third-party links
This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

## 2. Data we collect about you

We may collect personal information from you in the course of our business, including through your use of our website, when you contact or request information from us, when you join our network or as a result of your relationship with one or more of our staff.

## a. Data processing during general use of our website

When you access our website, we collect and process internet connection data as well as certain telemedia and usage data stored in the browser of your device.

- **(1) Internet connection data**

  When you call up our website, we process the internet connection data that your browser automatically transmits to our server. This is your IP address and other usage data (e.g. date and time of the call, name of the page called up, amount of data transferred and the requesting provider). We need this information to enable you to use our website, for example by adapting the website to the technical requirements of your device.

  This internet connection data may also be personal data. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest in ensuring the security and usability of our website, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. We store the personal data in question for a period of 35 days.

- **(2) Cookies**

  We use tracking technologies on our website that enable us or also our contractual partners or service providers to collect data relating to the use of our website. These tracking technologies are usually referred to as cookies, which is why we also use this term in the following. However, the following also applies accordingly to other tracking technologies or file formats, such as local storage, pixels, beacons or tags.

  Cookies are text files that are saved to the browser on your end device. User-related pseudonymous data can be stored for these files. This data can then be read out again.

  When you visit our website for the first time, we display a so-called cookie consent banner to inform you about the tracking technologies we use and to give you the choice of which optional cookies you would like to agree to. You can change your choice at any time in the Privacy Preference Centre on our website (see (vi) below).

  **(i)** Technically necessary cookies: In certain cases, the storage of information on your device or access to information already stored on your device is absolutely necessary so that we can make our website available to you for use ("Necessary Cookies"). Insofar as this information has a personal reference and is processed by us in our IT systems, the legal basis for this data processing is our justified interest in providing our website and ensuring the availability of our services, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

  **(ii)** Cookies requiring consent: We only use cookies that are not technically essential with your consent. We use the following categories of consent-requiring cookies:

  - Performance cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so that we can measure and improve the performance of our website. They help us answer questions about which pages are most popular, which are least used and how visitors move around the site. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not be able to know when you visited our website.

  - Functional cookies: These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third parties whose services we use on our website. If you do not allow these cookies, some or all of these services may not work properly.

  - Cookies for marketing purposes: These cookies may be set through our website by our advertising partners. They may be used by these companies to profile your interests and show you relevant ads on other websites. They do not directly store personal data, but are based on a unique identification of your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. You can find more information about the file names, storage duration, provider and category of the respective cookie in the cookie settings of the cookie consent banner or the data protection preference centre of the website. By clicking on the respective button (e.g. "Accept all cookies" or "Confirm selection") in the cookie consent banner or the data protection preference centre, you consent both to the storage and reading of information in these optional cookies via our website and to the further processing of any personal data (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).

  **(iii)** Google Analytics

  As a tool of a US provider, we use the Google Analytics by Google (Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, US). By clicking on the respective button (e.g. "Accept all cookies" or "Confirm selection") in the Cookie Consent Banner or the Privacy Preference Center, you consent both to the storage and retrieval of information in this optional cookie and to the further processing of any personal data retrieved (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). If you consent to the setting of the Google Analytics cookie, Google will collect data relating to your use of our website. This enables Google to assign data relating to usage behaviour on our website to this respective pseudonymous user. We have commissioned Google to use this information to evaluate the usage behaviour of the website, to compile reports on website activities and to provide us with further services related to website and internet usage. You can access Google's Privacy Policy here. The data processed by Google, in particular your IP address, is also stored on Google servers in the USA.

  **(iv)** Google Tag Manager

  As a tool of a US provider, we use the Google Tag Manager. The therefore implemented cookie is part of the Google Adwords tool and the associated Google Tag Manager for the purpose of so-called conversion tracking. By clicking on the respective button (e.g. "Accept all cookies" or "Confirm selection") in the Cookie Consent Banner or the Privacy Preference Center, you consent both to the storage and retrieval of information in this optional cookie and to the further processing of any personal data retrieved (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). If you give us your consent, Google processes the IP address and assigns a pseudonymous user ID. This enables Google to evaluate whether you have reached our website through a Google Ad and whether you have registered or not. You can access Google's Privacy Policy here. The data processed by Google, in particular your IP address, is also stored on Google servers in the USA.

  **(v)** Content Delivery Network (Cloudflare)

  We use the service "Cloudflare". The provider is Cloudflare Inc, 101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (hereinafter "Cloudflare"). Cloudflare offers a globally distributed content delivery network with DNS. This technically routes the transfer of information between your browser and our website via Cloudflare's network. This enables Cloudflare to analyse traffic between your browser and our website and act as a filter between our servers and potentially malicious traffic from the internet. In doing so, Cloudflare may also use cookies or other technologies to recognise internet users, but these are used solely for the purpose described here. The use of Cloudflare is based on our legitimate interest in providing our website as error-free and secure as possible (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR), as well as on your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR with regard to the cookies set. Further information on the topic of security and data protection at Cloudflare can be found here: [www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy).

  **(vi)** Withdrawal of your consents: You can withdraw your consents given in the cookie consent banner at any time for the future (Art. 7(3) GDPR). To do so, call up the data protection preference centre on our respective website. You can access the data protection preference centre by clicking on the link "Cookie Settings" in the footer of our website. In the data protection preference centre, you have the option to withdraw any consent you have already given by deselecting the relevant cookies. You can also select additional cookies and give us further consent.
  Your selection of optional cookies will in turn be saved as a cookie in your browser.

  **(vii)** Google reCaptcha (V3)

  We also use the "reCaptcha v3" captcha technology from Google. The use of reCaptcha v3 makes it possible to distinguish whether data entries on our websites were made by a human or automatically created by programs. To do this, Google analyses the behaviour of the website visitor on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website and runs completely in the background. For the analysis, Google evaluates various information from which a personal reference to the respective website visitor can be established (IP address, the behaviour of the website visitor, information about the operating system, browser and length of stay, display instructions and scripts, the input behaviour of the website visitor and mouse movements). The data collected during the analysis is also transmitted to Google servers located in the US and stored there. The data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, as we have a legitimate interest in protecting our websites from abusive and automated spying as well as SPAM. For more information on Google reCaptcha v3 and Google's privacy policy, please see the following links: <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/>, <https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de>.

## 3. Data Processing when you join our network

When you register on our website for joining our network, we process your email address password you set yourself. The legal basis for this data processing is the initiation and fulfilment of the contract concluded with you for the use of our network, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

When you want to join our network, we process further data from you. This data is

- Identity Data includes first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and gender.

- Data that you provide to us via the helpdesk and that we process in order to answer your support request.

The legal basis for this data processing is the initiation and fulfilment of the contract concluded with you, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

## 4. Data Processing for marketing purposes

We process your email address for advertising purposes (e.g. in the form of a newsletter) if either the requirements of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR – perhaps in conjunction with local laws about unfair competition, e.g. for Germany section 7(3) Unfair Competition Act (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb, "UWG") – are fulfilled or you have consented to receiving our e-mail advertising in accordance with Art. 6(1)(a), Art. 7 GDPR. If you would like to receive our e-mail advertising and register for it, we first collect your e-mail address and send you a confirmation e-mail with a confirmation link that you must click to subscribe to our advertising or to register for participation in the customer surveys. For sending our newsletter, we have implemented the service "Mailchimp" of The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a Mailchimp. We have entered into a Data Processing Agreement that meets the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.

You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. If you receive e-mail advertising from us as an existing customer, you can object to this advertising at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. You are also free to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time and without giving reasons for the future (Art. 21(2) GDPR). In the event of your withdrawal or objection, we will erase your data processed by us up to that point. This does not apply to data that we need to prove that you have given us consent in the past and that we have made lawful use of this consent. The processing of such data is then limited to this documentation and verification purpose. The storage is based on Art. 6(1)(c) and Art. 5(1)(c), as well as Art. 5(1)(a), Art. 5(2), Art. 7(1) GDPR and Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR and for the duration of the respective statutory limitation periods under criminal and civil law or separate, legally mandated retention periods.

## 5. Disclosures of your personal data

We use technical service providers (for example for hosting, customer data management software and telecommunication providers) as well as service providers for the processing of product orders who process your data according to our instructions on the basis of Data Processing Agreements pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR. We only disclose your data to other third parties if we are legally obliged to do so or if there is another legal basis for doing so.

## 6. International transfers

We are a company based in the USA. We may also transfer your personal data to recipients in other countries outside the European Union ("EU") and the European Economic Area. If the level of data protection there does not correspond to the level of data protection within the EU and no adequacy decision of the EU Commission is in place (Art. 45 GDPR), we provide suitable guarantees within the meaning of Art. 46 et seq. GDPR. This may include the agreement of standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) and any additional measures required to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

## 7. Data security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## 8. Data retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

Bylaw we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers.

In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
