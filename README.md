# Chirp Wireless Documentation

Welcome to the Chirp Wireless Documentation repository!

## Local Development

To set up the development environment and preview the documentation locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Yarn package manager. Install it globally via npm by running:
  ```sh
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:chirpwireless/docs.chirpwireless.io.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd docs.chirpwireless.io
   ```
3. Install the dependencies using Yarn:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

### Local Development Server

Once the installation is complete, you can start the local development server to preview the documentation:

```sh
yarn start
```

This command starts a development server and opens the documentation site in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the documentation files will be automatically reflected in the browser.
